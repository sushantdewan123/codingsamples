codingsamples
=============

All my random coding samples are part of this repo.
Whenever I hear about any coding challenge questions (be it simple or difficult!) from my friends or colleagues, 
I like to sit down and code them.
After the first cut, I look for opportunities to optimize my solution.
Also, to archive my solutions, I usually push them to this repository.
I know that github is meant for end to end projects and this effort might appear naive 
and too simplistic :), hey, but its better to persist your work online than to lose it :)
