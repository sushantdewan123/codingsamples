This is fun problem where we need to compute shortest path for a knight ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_(chess) ) 
from a given starting point to the bottom right grid of the chess board.
Lets assume that this is not an ordinary '8x8' chessboard. Instead the user can specify the value of n for a 'nxn' chessboard.
Print the shortest path from given starting point to the bottom right point. 
There are certain starting points which should be marked as point of no return. Throw an exception to the user for all such points.
